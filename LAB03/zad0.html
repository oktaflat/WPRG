    <h1>Tomoya Mashiro</h1>
    <h3>Official profile (! era)</h3>
    <p>A serious kid who tends to put things bluntly, Tomoya's a pessimist who gets dragged into situations around him fairly easily. While he hates being viewed as weird due to his unique surroundings, <em>he's also not happy with being thought of as "average".</em></p>
    <h4>Self Introduction (!! era)</h4>
    <blockquote>"I'm Tomoya Mashiro from Rhythm Link and the unit Ra*bits, which has a theme of being "small and cute." <em>I might be more "average" than everyone else...</em> However, my willingness to put a smile on all our fans' faces is unmatched! I'm still a bit unreliable, but I'll definitely grow into a magnificent idol that you'll be proud of, so please give me your support! Thank you...â™ª"</blockquote>
    <h4>Voice actor Comment (! era)</h4>
    <blockquote>"When I first saw the character chart, my impression was that he's a very adorable character. He seems friendly and has great affection for his upperclassmen--basically, he's like a little puppy. I still remember feeling very perplexed when the director asked me to portray him as <em>an average boy, with a capital A.</em> I feel that it's the most difficult to portray an ordinary, 'average' protagonist. While acting Mashiro-kun's role, I kept wondering what kind of image the audience has of an average boy. I'm very excited to see how his relationships with his classmates, upperclassmen, and especially close friends will develop! I hope everyone will look forward to his stories as well. Please treat him kindly!"</blockquote>
